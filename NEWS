1.1.0b2
======

[1] The plugin could incorrectly updated SOA record fields.

[2] The plugin could crashed on shutdown/reload when no zones in LDAP are
present.

[3] When using psearch, plugin could hung on shutdown/reload when connection to
LDAP was lost.

1.1.0b1
======

[1] Add support for IPv6 elements in idnsForwarders attribute
and make syntax compatible with BIND9 forwarders.

[2] Fix bug which caused named to crash during reload when failed to make a
connection to LDAP.

[3] Plugin is now able to fetch certain configuration options from LDAP. Check
README for more information.

[4] Many other bugfixes.

1.1.0a2
======

[1] Fix some errors reported by Coverity tool.

[2] Persistent search didn't propagate added/modified RRs to cache.

[3] DNS delegation now works fine.

[4] Relative domain names in resource records weren't expanded correctly
when psearch was used.

[5] The plugin could crash when LDAP contained DNS name with no data.

[6] Reworked idnsAllowQuery and idnsAllowTransfer support. We now 100% follow
BIND9 syntax.

[7] Fixed various bugs in code which synchronizes A/AAAA and it's PTR records.

1.1.0a1
======

[1] The plugin now skips only invalid record instead of the whole DN
when DN contains multiple records and one is invalid.

[2] New option "sync_ptr". When set to "yes" the plugin automatically
updates corresponding PTR records when A/AAAA update is received.
Zone must not have "idnsAllowDynUpdate" set to "no".

[3] New zone attribute idnsAllowSyncPTR which allows to enable PTR
synchronization per-zone.

[4] New idnsForwarders and idnsForwardPolicy attributes. You can set per-domain
forwarding with those options. See BIND 9 Administrator reference manual,
description of "forwarders", forward zones and "forward" options for details.

[5] Added support for zone transfers. Only AXFR is supported now.

[6] The plugin now periodically reconnects to LDAP when the first connection
attempt fails.

[7] New object class idnsConfigObject can be used to store plugin configuration
in LDAP. Only idnsForwarders option is currently supported. In future it's
planned to allow to store every bind-dyndb-ldap option valid in named.conf to be
stored in LDAP.

[8] Persistent search feature was extended to resource records.

[9] Many bugfixes, see git log for details.

1.0.0rc1
=======

[1] When connection to the LDAP was lost, the plugin didn't call the ldap_bind
during reconnection.

[2] Added new option "ldap_hostname" which allows to set LDAP server hostname
when it is different from actual /bin/hostname. This option sets the
LDAP_OPT_HOST_NAME option.

1.0.0b1
======

[1] Added new boolean option called "psearch". When this option is set to "yes"
then plugin will use advantage of psearch
(http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch-03.txt) to immediately
fetch new/modified/deleted zones from LDAP database. Note that the LDAP server
has to support the psearch as well.

[2] The plugin failed to set update ACLs for zones correctly.

[3] The FreeIPA CLI could have created update-policy attributes which contained
FQDNs ending with double-dot. Added a workaround to parse such crippled FQDNs.

[4] Race condition in semaphore_wait() could have caused server to hang.

[5] Major changes in the plugin code to make it more maintainable and readable.
