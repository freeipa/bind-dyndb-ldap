    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/161

[2] Configuration format in named.conf is different
    and incompatible with all previous versions. Please see README.md.

[3] Obsolete plugin options were removed:
    cache_ttl, psearch, serial_autoincrement, zone_refresh.

10.1
====
[1] Prevent crash while reloading previously invalid but now valid DNS zone.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/166

[2] Fix zone removal to respect forward configuration inheritance.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/167

10.0
====
[1] Default TTL can be configured at zone level in dNSdefaultTTL attribute.
    Please note that changes may not be applied until server reload.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/70

[2] Certain subset of configuration options can be specified
    in idnsServerConfigObject in LDAP. Each bind-dyndb-ldap instance will
    only use values from object with idnsServerId attribute matching server_id
    configured in named.conf. This can be used for per-server configuration
    in shared LDAP tree.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/162

[2] fake_mname option can be specified in idnsServerConfigObject in LDAP.
    Please note that changes may not be applied until server reload.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/162

[3] Per-server global forwarders can be configured in idnsServerConfigObject.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/162

[4] Dynamic record generation using idnsTemplateObject and
    idnsSubstitutionVariable;ipalocation attribute from idnsServerConfigObject
    is supported. Please see README.
    Please note that changes may not be applied until server reload.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/126

[5] Forwarding configuration is properly ignored for disabled master zones.

[6] Interaction between DNS root zone and global forwarding is now
    deterministic and root zone has higher priority over global forwarding.

[7] Various problems in internal event processing were fixed.

[8] Potential crash in early start-up phase was fixed.

[9] Compatibility with BIND >= 9.10.4b1 was improved

9.0
====
[1] Automatic empty zones conflicting with forward zones with policy 'only'
    are now automatically unloaded. Warning is issued if the conflicting
    forward zone has policy 'first' but the zone is not unloaded.
    Conflict occurs if empty zone and forward zone are super/sub/equal domains.
!!! This changes semantics of data in LDAP.
!!! Users have to upgrade their data manually.

8.0
====
[1] Unknown record types can be stored in LDAP using generic syntax (RFC 3597).
    LDAP schema was extended for this purpose with the UnknownRecord attribute.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/157

[2] PTR record synchronization was improved.
    - New PTR records now inherit the TTL value from the respective A/AAAA
      records.
    - SERVFAIL error is no longer returned to clients if A/AAAA record update
      succeeded but PTR record synchronization failed because of
      misconfiguration. Such errors are only logged.
    - PTR record synchronization was reworked to reduce the probability
      of race condition occurrences.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/155

[3] LDAP rename (MODRDN) for DNS records is now supported.
    Renaming of whole DNS zones is not supported and will lead to errors.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/123

[4] Data changed in LDAP while connection to server was down are now refreshed
    properly.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/128

[5] Crash caused by object class and DN format mismatch were fixed.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/148

[6] Compatibility with BIND 9.9.4 was improved.

[7] Documentation and schema were fixed and improved. The doc/schema.ldif file
    is now properly formatted as LDIF and contains instructions
    for OpenLDAP and 389 DS.

7.0
====
[1] Support for BIND 9.10 was added.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/139

6.1
====
[1] Crash caused by interaction between forward and master zones was fixed.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/145

[2] DNS NOTIFY messages are sent after any modification to the zone.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/144

[3] Misleading error message about forward zones during reconnect was fixed.

[4] Informational message about number of defined/loaded zones was improved.

[5] Various build system improvements.

6.0
====
[1] idnsZoneActive attribute is supported again and zones can be activated
    and deactivated at run-time.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/127

5.3
====
[1] Internal locking was reworked to prevent crashes and deadlocks.

5.2
====
[1] Kerberos ticket expiration is now handled correctly.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/131

[2] BIND no longer crashes after removing root zone from LDAP.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/138

[3] Root zone handling was fixed to prevent accidental child zone removal.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/122

[4] Temporary files for idnsZone objects are now inside master/ subdirectory.

[5] Temporary directories are created with ug=rwx,o= permissions to enable
    POSIX ACL usage.

[6] Naming rules for working directories have changed: See README section 6.

[7] Documentation clearly states that idnsZoneActive attribute is not supported.

5.1
====
[1] Fix crash during reconnection to LDAP.

5.0
====
[1] Support for DNSSEC in-line signing was added. Now any LDAP zone can be
    signed with keys provided by user.

[2] DNSKEY, RRSIG, NSEC and NSEC3 records are automatically managed
    by BIND+bind-dyndb-ldap. Respective attributes in LDAP are ignored.

[3] Forwarder semantic was changed to match BIND's semantic:
    - idnsZone object always represent master zone
    - idnsForwardZone object (new) always represent forward zone

[4] Master root zone can be stored in LDAP.

4.4
====
[1] Error handling for zone loading was fixed.

4.3
====
[1] LDAP update processing was fixed to prevent BIND from crashing during
    shutdown.

4.2
====
[1] Record parsing was fixed to prevent child-zone data corruption in cases
    where parent zone example.com was hosted on the same server as child zone
    sub.example.com. (This bug was introduced in version 4.0.)

4.1
====
[1] Fix few minor bugs in error handling found by static code analyzers.

4.0
====
[1] Persistent search and zone refresh were replaced by RFC 4533 (SyncRepl).
    Options zone_refresh, cache_ttl and psearch were removed.
    Also LDAP attributes idnsZoneRefresh and idnsPersistentSearch were removed.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/120

[2] Internal database was re-factored and replaced by RBT DB from BIND 9.
    As a result, read-query performance is nearly same as with plain BIND.
    Wildcard records are supported and queries for non-existing records
    do not impose additional load on LDAP server.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/95
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/6

[3] Plug-in creates journal file for each DNS zone in LDAP. This allows us
    to support IXFR. Working directory has to be writable by named,
    please see README - configuration option "directory".
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/64

[4] SOA serial auto-increment feature is now mandatory. The plugin has to have
    write access to LDAP.
    (Proper SOA serial maintenance is required for journaling.)

[5] Data are not served to clients until initial synchronization with LDAP
    is finished. All queries are answered with NXDOMAIN during synchronization.

[6] Crash caused by invalid SOA record was fixed.

[7] Empty instance names (specified by "dynamic-db" directive) were disallowed.

[8] Typo in LDAP schema was fixed.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/121

Known problems and limitations
[1] LDAP MODRDN (rename) is not supported at the moment.

[2] Zones enabled at run-time are not loaded properly.
    You have to restart BIND after changing idnsZoneActive attribute to TRUE.

[3] Zones and records deleted when connection to LDAP is down are not
    refreshed properly after re-connection.
    You have to restart BIND to restore consistency.

3.6
=====
[1] Crash triggered by invalid SOA record was fixed.

[2] Minor logging improvements and code clean-up.

3.5
=====
[1] Crash triggered by zone_refresh with broken connection to LDAP was fixed.

[2] Code was changed to not trigger false positives in Clang static analyzer.

[3] Persistent search is enabled by default.

[4] Options cache_ttl, psearch and zone_refresh were formally deprecated.

3.4
=====
[1] Crash during BIND shutdown caused by race condition in update processing
    was fixed.

3.3
=====
[1] Crash triggered by missing sasl_user parameter was fixed.

[2] IPv6 handling in PTR record synchronization was fixed.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/118

[3] Authentication settings are validated more strictly.
    Conflicting options are reported and prevent named from starting.

[4] Automatic empty zones defined in RFC 6303 are automatically unloaded
    if conflicting master or forward zone is defined in LDAP.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/119

[5] Configuration without persistent search is now deprecated
    and informational message is logged. Support for zone_refresh
    will be removed in 4.x release.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/120

3.2
=====
[1] An error in dynamic update/transfer/query policy is interpreted as
    most restrictive policy, i.e. nobody is allowed to update/transfer/query
    the zone.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/116

[2] Attempts to update zones with idnsAllowDynUpdate == FALSE are logged.

[3] TTL values > 2^31-1 are interpreted as 0.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/117

[4] All RR types supported by BIND are automatically supported by plugin.
    From now it is enough to add new attribute type to LDAP schema,
    no recompilation is required.

[5] PTR record synchronization deletes only PTR records, but no other records
    (e.g. TXT) under names in the reverse zone.

[6] Various improvements related to logging (dynamic updates, PTR record
    synchronization, LDAP error handling).

3.1
=====
[1] Crash caused by zone deletion introduced by 
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/99
    was fixed.

3.0
=====
[1] DNAME records are supported. DNAME attribute was changed to single-valued.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/63

[2] Master and forward zones now have separate object classes:
    idnsZone and idnsForwardZone. idnsForward* attributes in idnsZone object
    class will have old semantics for some time.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/99

[3] Settings system was heavily refactored. From now, unknown options in
    configuration file cause error. DNS dynamic updates should create
    slightly lower load on LDAP server because of settings 'cache'.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/53
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/81

[4] Deadlock triggered by PTR record synchronization was fixed.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/113

2.6
=====
[1] Invalid zones are automatically reloaded after each change in zone data.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/102

[2] Plugin periodically reconnects when KDC is unavailable.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/100

[3] Invalid wildcard name in update-policy no longer crashes BIND.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/108

[4] Crash caused by idnsAllowSyncPTR attribute in global configuration object
    in LDAP was fixed.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/110

[5] Crash caused by invalid query/transfer policy was fixed.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/109

[6] Crash caused by 'zonesub' match-type in update ACL was fixed.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/111

[7] Support for update-policy match type 'external' was added.

[8] Various improvements related to logging.

2.5
=====
[1] Fix crash during per-zone cache flush.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/107

2.4
=====
[1] Missing SOA serial number in zone object is treated as 1.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/103

[2] Each zone has separate record cache. It should prevent problems
    during record rename.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/91

[3] False warning 'zone serial (2012060301) unchanged' should not pop-up.
    https://fedorahosted.org/bind-dyndb-ldap/ticket/79

[4] New option 'verbose_checks yes' enables more verbose logging.

[5] Various error handling and logging improvements.
    All bugs reported by Clang static analyzer were fixed.

======
[1] Compatibility with BIND 9.8 was restored.

2.1
======
[1] Forward policy "none" was introduced.

[2] Internal record cache is flushed properly on new forward zone load.

[3] Forwarding will be disabled after deleting associated forward zone.

2.0
======
[1] SOA serial number can be incremented automatically after each change
    in LDAP database. (Configuration option "serial_autoincrement".)

[2] It was possible to DoS named service via quiery which contained
    $ character. CVE-2012-3429 was fixed.

[3] DNS Dynamic Update returns codes NOTAUTH and REFUSED properly.

[4] BIND doesn't refuse to start if initial connection times out.

[5] Object renaming (LDAP moddn) in persistent mode is handled properly.

[6] Internal record cache is flushed properly after reconnection
    to the LDAP server (in configurations with persistent search).

[7] Simple time-based deadlock detection code was added. Error message
    is printed after 10*(timeout) seconds.
    Some deadlocks in various situations with low connection count were fixed.

[8] Libdns interface version >= 90 is supported properly.

[9] Zone transfers were fixed. Records with non-FQDNs are handled properly.

[10] Logging was improved.

[11] Memory leaks in dynamic update, persistent search, ldap_query
     and configurations with multiple plugin instances were fixed.

[12] Version numbering format changed to: [features].[bugfixes]

[13] Many other bugfixes

1.1.0rc1
======

[1] It was possible to DoS named service via query which contained non-alphabet
character. (CVE-2012-2134)

[2] The plugin wrote ambiguous "zone has been removed" messages to the log.

[3] The plugin failed to return A/AAAA delegation glue records.

[4] Fixes for memory leaks in code which handles Kerberos authentication.

1.1.0b2
======

[1] The plugin could incorrectly updated SOA record fields.

[2] The plugin could crashed on shutdown/reload when no zones in LDAP are
present.

[3] When using psearch, plugin could hung on shutdown/reload when connection to
LDAP was lost.

1.1.0b1
======

[1] Add support for IPv6 elements in idnsForwarders attribute
and make syntax compatible with BIND9 forwarders.

[2] Fix bug which caused named to crash during reload when failed to make a
connection to LDAP.

[3] Plugin is now able to fetch certain configuration options from LDAP. Check
README for more information.

[4] Many other bugfixes.

1.1.0a2
======

[1] Fix some errors reported by Coverity tool.

[2] Persistent search didn't propagate added/modified RRs to cache.

[3] DNS delegation now works fine.

[4] Relative domain names in resource records weren't expanded correctly
when psearch was used.

[5] The plugin could crash when LDAP contained DNS name with no data.

[6] Reworked idnsAllowQuery and idnsAllowTransfer support. We now 100% follow
BIND9 syntax.

[7] Fixed various bugs in code which synchronizes A/AAAA and it's PTR records.

1.1.0a1
======

[1] The plugin now skips only invalid record instead of the whole DN
when DN contains multiple records and one is invalid.

[2] New option "sync_ptr". When set to "yes" the plugin automatically
updates corresponding PTR records when A/AAAA update is received.
Zone must not have "idnsAllowDynUpdate" set to "no".

[3] New zone attribute idnsAllowSyncPTR which allows to enable PTR
synchronization per-zone.

[4] New idnsForwarders and idnsForwardPolicy attributes. You can set per-domain
forwarding with those options. See BIND 9 Administrator reference manual,
description of "forwarders", forward zones and "forward" options for details.

[5] Added support for zone transfers. Only AXFR is supported now.

[6] The plugin now periodically reconnects to LDAP when the first connection
attempt fails.

[7] New object class idnsConfigObject can be used to store plugin configuration
in LDAP. Only idnsForwarders option is currently supported. In future it's
planned to allow to store every bind-dyndb-ldap option valid in named.conf to be
stored in LDAP.

[8] Persistent search feature was extended to resource records.

[9] Many bugfixes, see git log for details.

1.0.0rc1
=======

[1] When connection to the LDAP was lost, the plugin didn't call the ldap_bind
during reconnection.

[2] Added new option "ldap_hostname" which allows to set LDAP server hostname
when it is different from actual /bin/hostname. This option sets the
LDAP_OPT_HOST_NAME option.

1.0.0b1
======

[1] Added new boolean option called "psearch". When this option is set to "yes"
then plugin will use advantage of psearch
(http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-ldapext-psearch-03.txt) to immediately
fetch new/modified/deleted zones from LDAP database. Note that the LDAP server
has to support the psearch as well.

[2] The plugin failed to set update ACLs for zones correctly.

[3] The FreeIPA CLI could have created update-policy attributes which contained
FQDNs ending with double-dot. Added a workaround to parse such crippled FQDNs.

[4] Race condition in semaphore_wait() could have caused server to hang.

[5] Major changes in the plugin code to make it more maintainable and readable.
