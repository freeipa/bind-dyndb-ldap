This directory contains pretty-printers which make easier to read
bind-dyndb-ldap data structures in GDB with Python support.

To use them, simply source the files into GDB:
(gdb) source /path/to/pretty/printer.py

BEWARE:
The pretty printers work well if memory is not corrupted.
Disable pretty printers if you suspect memory corruption:
(gdb) disable pretty-printer

Pretty-printers for BIND 9 data structures might be handy, too:
