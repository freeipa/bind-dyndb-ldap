1. Introduction
===============

The dynamic LDAP back-end is a plug-in for BIND that provides an LDAP
database back-end capabilities. For now, it requires that BIND is patched
to support dynamic loading of database back-ends. You can get a patch
for your version here:

  http://github.com/mnagy/bind-dynamic_db/downloads

Hopefully, the patch will once be included in the official BIND release.

Because of bug in dns_db_unregister() in older BIND versions, BIND >= 9.7.0a1
is required.

2. Features
===========
* support for dynamic updates
* SASL authentication
* persistent search for zones (experimental)


3. Installation
===============

To install the LDAP back-end, extract the tarball and go to the unpacked
directory. Then follow these steps:

$ ./configure --libdir=<libdir>
$ make

Where <libdir> is a directory where your libdns is installed. This is
typically going to be /usr/lib or /usr/lib64 on 64 bit systems.

If configure script complains that it "Can't obtain libdns version",
please verify you have installed bind development files (package bind9-dev
or bind-devel) and you exported correct CPPFLAGS via
"export CPPFLAGS=`isc-config.sh --cflags`" command.

Then, to install, run this as root:
# make install

This will install the file ldap.so into the <libdir>/bind/ directory.


4. LDAP schema
==============

You can find the complete LDAP schema in the documentation directory. An
example zone ldif is available in the doc directory.

4.1 Zone (idnsZone) attributes
------------------------------

* idnsAllowDynUpdate
	Allow dynamic update of records in this zone. If attribute doesn't exist,
	value "dyn_update" from plugin configuration will be used.

* idnsAllowQuery
	Specifies BIND9 zone ACL element. This attribute can be set multiple
	times and are merged together to the one ACL.

	Example:
		idnsAllowQuery: 127.0.0.1
		idnsAllowQuery: ::1
		idnsAllowQuery: 192.168.1.0/24

	In the example above clients with 127.0.0.1 and ::1 IP addresses and
	clients from the 192.168.1.0/24 network are allowed to obtain records
	from the zone.

	You can specify IPv4/IPv6 address, IPv4/IPv6 network address in CIDR
	format and "any" or "none" keywords. The "!" prefix (for example
	!192.168.1.0/24) means negation of the ACL element.

	If not set then zone inherits global allow-query from named.conf.

* idnsAllowTransfer
	Uses same format as idnsAllowQuery. Allows zone transfers for matching
	clients.

	If not set then zone inherits global allow-transfer from named.conf.

* idnsAllowSyncPTR
	Allow synchronization of A/AAAA records in zone with PTR records in reverse
	zone. Reverse zone must have Dynamic update allowed. 
	(See idnsAllowDynUpdate attribute and dyn_update configuration parameter.)

* idnsForwardPolicy (default "first")
	Specifies BIND9 zone forward policy. Proprietary value "none"
	is equivalent to "forwarders {};" in BIND configuration,
	i.e. effectively disables forwarding and ignores idnsForwarders
	attribute.

	Value "none" disables forwarding for given zone and ignores
	global forwarders. Zone with forward policy "none" is considered
	as type "master", not "forward".
	Values "first" and "only" are relevant in conjunction with a valid
	idnsForwarders attribute. Their meaning is same as in BIND9.

* idnsForwarders
	Defines multiple IP addresses to which queries will be forwarded and
	effectively creates "forward" zones.
	It is multi-value attribute: Each IP address (and optional port) has to
	be in own value. BIND9 syntax for "forwarders" is required.
	Optional port can be specified by adding " port <number>" after IP 
	address. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are supported.
	Examples: "1.2.3.4" or "1.2.3.4 port 553" or "A::B" or "A::B port 553"

	Zones with idnsForwarders attribute specified and forward policy other
	than "none" are considered as "forward" zones. All records in LDAP
	belonging to those zones are ignored and all queries are forwarded.


5. Configuration
================

To configure dynamic loading of back-end, you must put a "dynamic-db"
clause into your named.conf. The clause must then be followed by a
string denoting the name. The name is not that much important, it is
passed to the plug-in and might be used for example, for logging
purposes. Following after that is a set of options enclosed between
curly brackets.

The most important option here is "library". It names a shared object
file that will be opened and loaded. The "arg" option specifies a string
that is passed directly to the plugin. You can specify multiple "arg"
options. The LDAP back-end follows the convention that the first word of
this string is the name of the setting and the rest is the value.


5.1 Configuration options
-------------------------
List of configuration options follows:

uri
	The Uniform Resource Identifier pointing to the LDAP server we
	wish to connect to. This string is directly passed to the
	ldap_initialize(3) function. This option is mandatory.
	Example: ldap://ldap.example.com

connections (default 2)
	Number of connections the LDAP driver should try to establish to
	the LDAP server. It's best if this matches the number of threads
	BIND creates, for performance reasons. However, your LDAP server
	configuration might only allow certain number of connections per
	client.

base
	This is the search base that will be used by the LDAP back-end
	to search for DNS zones. It is mandatory.

auth_method (default "none")
	The method used to authenticate to the LDAP server. Currently
	supported methods are "none", "simple" and "sasl". The none
	method is effectively a simple authentication without password.

bind_dn (default "")
	Distinguished Name used to bind to the LDAP server. If this is
	empty and the auth_method is set to "simple", the LDAP back-end
	will fall-back and use the "none" authentication method.

password (default "")
	Password for simple and SASL authentication. If the authentication
	method is set to "simple" and the password is empty, the LDAP
	driver will fall-back to the "none" authentication method.

sasl_mech (default "GSSAPI")
	Name of the SASL mechanism to be used for negotiation.

sasl_auth_name
	The user name to be used for SASL authentication.

sasl_user
	The user name to be used for SASL proxy authorization.

sasl_password
	The password to use for the SASL authentication.

sasl_realm
	The SASL realm name.

krb5_keytab
	Path to the kerberos keytab containing service credentials to be used
	for SASL authentication. Append the "FILE:" prefix to the file path.
	(FILE:/etc/named.keytab, for example)

krb5_principal
	Kerberos principal of the service, used for SASL authentication.
	If not set then it is copied from "sasl_user" option. Principal
	is loaded from file specified in "krb5_keytab" option.

cache_ttl (default 120)
	This is the number of seconds to keep DNS records that we get
	from the LDAP server in an internal cache. To disable the
	caching completely, set this to 0. If your LDAP server is under
	a heavy load and/or you don't update your records very often, you
	probably want to set this option on a higher value.

zone_refresh (default 0)
	! This option is DEPRECATED and will be removed in the future. !
	Interval (in seconds) of how often the LDAP driver should query the
	LDAP server for changes in zone settings. If this option is set to 0,
	the LDAP driver will never refresh the settings.
	Currently, global settings in idnsConfigObject and zone specific
	settings in idnsZone attributes are refreshed.
	Zone refresh and persistent search (psearch) are mutually exclusive.

timeout (default 10)
	Timeout (in seconds) of the queries to the LDAP server. If the LDAP
	server don't respond before this timeout then lookup is aborted and
	BIND returns SERVFAIL. Value "0" means infinite timeout (no timeout).

fake_mname (default "")
	Ignore value of the idnsSOAmName (primary master DNS name) attribute
	and use this value instead. This allows multiple BIND processes to share
	one LDAP database and every BIND reports itself as a primary master in
	SOA record, for example.

psearch (default no)
	! Persistent search will be mandatory in future releases. !
	Set this option to "yes" if you would like to use persistent search
	query for zone records and global settings. When server supports
	persistent search your zones and configuration will be automatically 
	update when they change in LDAP.
	Enabling psearch disables zone_refresh.

reconnect_interval (default 60)
	Time (in seconds) after that the plugin should try to connect to LDAP 
	server again in case connection is lost and immediate reconnection 
	fails.

ldap_hostname (default "")
	Sets hostname of the LDAP server. When it is set to "", actual
	/bin/hostname is used. Please prefer "uri" option, this option should be
	used only in special cases, for example when GSSAPI authentication
	is used and named service has Kerberos principal different from
	/bin/hostname output.

serial_autoincrement (default no)
	Automatically increment SOA serial number after each change in LDAP.
	External changes done by other LDAP clients are detected with
	persistent search.

	If serial number is lower than current UNIX timestamp, then
	it is set to the timestamp value. If SOA serial is greater or equal
	to current timestamp, then the serial is incremented by one.

	In multi-master LDAP environments it is recommended to make
	idnsSOAserial attribute non-replicated (locally significant).
	It is recommended to not use multiple masters for single slave zone
	if SOA serial is locally significant. Serial numbers between masters
	aren't synchronized. It will cause problems with zone transfers from
	multiple masters.

	This function requires persistent search and 4 connections at least.

sync_ptr (default no)
	Set this option to "yes" if you would like to keep PTR record 
	synchronized with coresponding A/AAAA record for all zones.
	If this option is set to "no", the LDAP driver will check
	the idnsAllowSyncPTR attribute which specifies the synchronization
	policy for PTR records in a zone. When an A/AAAA record is deleted 
	the PTR record must point to the same hostname. 
	
dyn_update (default no)
	Set this option to "yes" if you would like to allow dynamic zone updates.
	This setting can be overridden for each zone individually
	by idnsAllowDynUpdate attribute.

verbose_checks (default no)
	Set this option to "yes" if you would like to log all failures
	in internal CHECK() macros. This option is recommended only for
	debugging purposes. It could produce huge amount of log messages
	on a loaded system!

5.2 Sample configuration
------------------------
Let's take a look at a sample configuration:

dynamic-db "my_db_name" {
	library "ldap.so";
	arg "uri ldap://ldap.example.com";
	arg "base cn=dns, dc=example, dc=com";
	arg "auth_method none";
	arg "cache_ttl 300";
};

With this configuration, the LDAP back-end will try to connect to server
ldap.example.com with simple authentication, without any password. It
will then do an LDAP subtree search in the "cn=dns,dc=example,dc=com"
base for entries with object class idnsZone, for which the
idnsZoneActive attribute is set to True. For each entry it will find, it
will register a new zone with BIND. The LDAP back-end will keep each
record it gets from LDAP in its cache for 5 minutes.

5.3 Configuration in LDAP
-------------------------
Some options can be configured in LDAP as idnsConfigObject attributes.
Value configured in LDAP has priority over value in configuration file.
(This behavior will change in future versions!)
Configuration is updated at same time as zone refresh.

Following options are supported (option = attribute equivalent):

forwarders = idnsForwarders (BIND native option)
forward = idnsForwardPolicy (BIND native option)
sync_ptr = idnsAllowSyncPTR
zone_refresh = idnsZoneRefresh

Forward policy option cannot be set without setting forwarders at the same time.
Zone refresh interval is ignored on target server if psearch is enabled.
